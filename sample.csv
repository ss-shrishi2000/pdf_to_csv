?,"TDMA shares a single carrier frequency with several users, where each user makes use of"
"",non-overlapping time slots. The number of time slots per frame depends on several
"","factors, such as modulation technique, available bandwidth, etc."
?,Data transmission for users of a TDMA system is not continuous but occurs in bursts.
?,"Adaptive equalization is usually necessary in TDMA systems, since the transmission"
"",rates are generally very high as compared to FDMA channels.
?,"In TDMA, the guard time should be minimized. If the transmitted signal at the edges of a"
"","time slot are suppressed sharply in order to shorten the guard time, the transmitted spec-"
"",trum will expand and cause interference to adjacent channels.
?,High synchronization overhead is required in TDMA systems because of burst transmis-
"","sions. TDMA transmissions are slotted, and this requires the receivers to be synchronized"
"","for each data burst. In addition, guard slots are necessary to separate users, and this"
"",results in the TDMA systems having larger overheads as compared to FDMA.
?,TDMA has an advantage in that it is possible to allocate different numbers of time slots
?,Many users of a CDMA system share the same frequency. Either TDD or FDD may be
"",used.
?,"Unlike TDMA or FDMA, CDMA has a soft capacity limit. Increasing the number of"
"","users in a CDMA system raises the noise floor in a linear manner. Thus, there is no"
"","absolute limit on the number of users in CDMA. Rather, the system performance"
"","gradually degrades for all users as the number of users is increased, and improves as the"
"",number of users is decreased.

Why OFDM
OFDM is very effective for communication over channels with frequency selective fading (
different frequency components of the signal experience different fading). It is very difficult to
"handle frequency selective fading in the receiver , in which case, the design of the receiver is"
hugely complex. Instead of trying to mitigate frequency selective fading as a whole (which
occurs when a huge bandwidth is allocated for the data transmission over a frequency selective
"fading channel), OFDM mitigates the problem by converting the entire frequency selective"
fading channel into small flat fading channels (as seen by the individual subcarriers). Flat fading

correction and equalization schemes.
Difference between FDM and OFDM:
"OFDM isa special case of FDM (Frequency DivisionMultiplexing).InFDM, thegiven"
bandwidth is subdivided among a set of carriers. There is no relationship between the carrier
"frequencies in FDM. For example, consider that the given bandwidth has to be divided among 5"
"carriers(saya,b,c,d,e).Thereisnorelationshipbetweenthesubcarriers;a,b,c,dandecan"
"anything within the given bandwidth.If the carriers are harmonics, say (b=2a,c=3a,d=4a,d=5a ,"
integral multiple of fundamental component a ) then they become orthogonal. This is a special
"case of FDM, which is called OFDM (as implied by the word – ‘orthogonal’ in OFDM)"
Designing OFDM Transmitter:
"Consider that we want to send the following data bits using OFDM : D = {d0,d1,d2,...)."
The first thing that should be considered in designing the OFDM transmitter is the number of
"subcarriers required to send the given data. As a generic case, lets assume that we have N"
subcarriers.Eachsubcarriersarecenteredatfrequenciesthatareorthogonaltoeachother
(usually multiples of frequencies).
The second design parameter could be the modulation format that we wish to use. An
OFDM signal can be constructed using anyone of the following digital modulation techniques
"namely BPSK, QPSK, QAM etc.., .The data (D) has to be first converted from serial stream into"
parallel stream depending on the number of sub-carriers (N). Since we assumed that there are N
"subcarriers allowed for the OFDM transmission, we name the subcarriers from 0 to N-1. Now,"
the Serial to Parallel converter takes the serial stream of input bits and outputs N parallel streams
(indexed from 0 to N-1). These parallel streams are individually converted into the required
"digital modulation format (BPSK, QPSK, QAM etc..,). Lets call this output S0,S1,..SN. The"
conversion of parallel data (D) into the digitally modulated data (S) is usually achieved by a

ew Mobile Stations (MS) are required to use GPRS services because existing GSM phones do

PRS Base Station Subsyste
ach BSC requires the installation of one or more Packet Control Units (PCUs) and a software
pgrade. The PCU provides a physical and logical data interface to the Base Station Subsystem
BSS) for packet data traffic. The BTS can also require a software upgrade but typically does not
equire hardware enhancements.

"ir interface to the BTS, and from the BTS to the BSC in the same way as a standard GSM call."

used to enable second-generation global system for mobile communication (GSM) and
time division multiple access (TDMA) networks to transmit data at up to 384 kilobits per
second (Kbps).
"•EDGEprovidesspeedenhancementsbychangingthetypeofmodulationusedand"
making a better use of the carrier currently used.
"•It enables a greater data-transmission speed by implementing an eight-phase-shift keying"
(8 PSK) modulation instead of Gaussian minimum-shift keying (GMSK).
"•EDGE is a technology that gives GSM Networks the capacity to handle services for 3G."
"•EDGE was developed to enable the transmission of large amounts of data at peak rates of"
up to 472kbps.
"•Users should experience average speeds of 80 kbps to 130 kbps."
"•EDGE devices are backwards compatible with GPRS."
"•Although EDGE reuses the GSM carrier bandwidth and time slot structure and air"

"•EDGE uses the same TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) frame structure, logic"
channel and 200 kHz carrier bandwidth as today's GSM networks.
Features
?It was standardized by 3GPP as a part of GSM family and was deployed in GSM networks in
2003.
?The other names for EDGE are Enhanced GPRS (EGPRS) and IMT-Single Carrier (IMT-
SC).
"?It is compatible with any packet – switched application. It is also backward – compatible, i.e."
compatible with existing or older versions.
?It enables data to be sent over a GSM TDMA systems at speeds of 384Kbps. GSM uses the
modulation technique called Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying (GMSK). EDGE achieves
increased bit rate by using 8PSK modulation scheme.
"?In order to shift from GSM to GSM EDGE, additional network elements are incorporated to"
enable IP based data transfer. The two main additional nodes required are ?
oGateway GPRS Service Node (GGSN)
oServing GPRS Service Node (SGSN)
?GSM EDGE compatible mobile handsets are required to avail the service.
